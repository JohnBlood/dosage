# Dosage snap

a snap for [dosage](https://dosage.rocks/), a comic downloader and archiver.


Use the following command to install my dosage snap:

`sudo snap install dosage`

## Usage

In order to use this snap, you need to use the `dosage-johnblood378.dosage` command instead of `dosage`. You can also create a manual alias by running `sudo snap alias dosage dosage-johnblood378`. You can read more about [snap aliases here](https://docs.snapcraft.io/commands-and-aliases/3950). I am currently requesting a automatic alias from the snap gods. You can find more usage info [here](https://dosage.rocks/).

## Note:

I do not own dosage. I think it is a great app and want to make it easy to install.
